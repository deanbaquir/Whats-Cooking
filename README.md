`git status`\
Make Sure All Files Are Staged\
`git commit -m "Message"`\
`git push origin <BranchName>`\
Look On Github And Create New Pull Request Using The New Branch\
Then Go Back To Main Branch, And Update Local Repo\
`git checkout main`\
`git pull origin main`\
Rinse And Repeat For Every `Feature | Bug | Fix`
